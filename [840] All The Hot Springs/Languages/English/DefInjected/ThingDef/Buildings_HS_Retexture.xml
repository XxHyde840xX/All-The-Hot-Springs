		<StandaloneHotSpringEXJ.description>A natural hot spring whose steaming waters act as a meditative joy source, help cleanse the body of illnesses, and assist in the healing of wounds. Built on top of a naturally occuring steam geyser.\n\nA large amount of clever excavation and painstakingly assembled stoneworks are required to allow the boiling hot waters deep underground to come to the surface as pure bathing water. Construction of this building requires an exceptionally high amount of labor. Average constructors will need several workdays in optimal conditions to complete this building. \n\nThis building can be manually used. Sick and/or injured pawns that are capable of moving on their own should be directed to use the spring once a day. Pawns incapable of moving cannot safely use the spring's waters without undue risk of drowning, and are thus forbidden.</StandaloneHotSpringEXJ.description>
